# ARDF Results Viewer - Frontend

This frontend project is designed to work with the ARDF-FJWw backend application, which you can find [here](https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repository). The ARDF Results Viewer is a web application built to display and share the ARDF competition results from the BIZON CUP 2023. It fetches the latest results data from the backend API and displays it to the user.
